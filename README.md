Introduction
In May 2017 Google released the Architecture Components libraries. Each library manages and simplifies aspects of data persistence and the UI component lifecycle. Together, the libraries encourage a modular app architecture that results in reduced complexity and less code.

This sample shows how to use the libraries to build a complete basic app that implements the recommended architecture and can be used as a template for further explorations.

Pre-requisites
Android Studio 3.0 or later and you know how to use it.

Make sure Android Studio is updated, as well as your SDK and Gradle. Otherwise, you may have to wait for a while until all the updates are done.

A device or emulator that runs API level 26

You need to be solidly familiar with the Java programming language, object-oriented design concepts, and Android Development Fundamentals. In particular:

RecyclerView and Adapters
SQLite database and the SQLite query language
Threadig and AsyncTask

Getting Started
Install Android Studio, if you don't already have it.
Download the sample.
Import the sample into Android Studio.
Build and run the sample.
